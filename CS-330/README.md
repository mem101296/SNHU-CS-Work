### How do I approach designing software?


**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
- This has helped reinforced skills that I already have and use daily

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**
- When designing software I start by reading the requirements and understanding what is being asked. From there I start by building the first requirement and confirming it works, from there I rinse and repeat until the project is done. Once done I go back and see if there is anything I can do to optimize or improve on. So far this has worked for me with most, if not all my classes.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
- I use this all the time when implementing projects at work.

### How do I approach developing programs?
**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
- When developing my 3D I broke down and commented on the code to allow for myself to not get lost and to not forget what code does if I have to step away for more than a couple of days.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**
- While developing the 3D scene I would apply changes and run the code to ensure it didn't break anything and that the changes did what I assumed they would. This helped me understand what each change was doing, which made me more efficient on the file project.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
- Not much has changed. Being almost in my last year of school, I have found a way that works.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
- This will help me build my personal game that I have decided to build due to this class. The knowledge from this class will also help me with future class, and hopefully assist me later in life when I go for my masters.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
- At the moment it doesn't help me much, as I'm currently in IT. It may help later down the line when working with algorithms.
