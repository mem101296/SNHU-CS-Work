- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

To create an application to help with item inventory. I wanted the application to work with small and large businesses, while being intuitive and easy to use

- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

It needed a Login Screen, User Sign Up, Main Inventory page, and a setting page. My UI kept everything easy to find and use, the buttons where in easy to reach and convient spots.

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I started with the UI and built the functionality after. This seemed to work best for me, as it allowed me to see what is was supposed to look like.

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ran the application on my personal device and coded in Log.d into each function which outputted the data so I could ensure the right data was being passed between classes and functions.
 
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I have to create a work around to get multiple databases working within the same class. 
    
- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the database, login screen, and sign up screen is the best at demonstrating the knowledge and skills I learned in this class.
