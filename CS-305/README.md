- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company looking to modernize their applications security.

- What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I feel I did well in identifying and resolving security issues within their application, whether it be static testing or a vulnerability assessment. Keeping software securite helps the company build trust with their user base. A user does not want to worry about if an application is secure or not.   

- What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

I felt the initial instructions on how to add a vulnerabiliy assessment to a project was challenging to understand. I also felt that identifying false positives was not clear enough and could have used more detail.

- How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I started by updating the dependencies of the program, and from there I added secure code, then I ran the vulnerability accessment. 

- How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured the code was secure and functional by running the program and checking if it functioned as intended, as well as ran a new vulnerability test every time new code was introduced.

- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I ended up using search engines and YouTube to help when I got stuck. It comes down to what the employer wants to see. Showing that I can run a vulnerability check against a running program can be useful. Showing the hash function would also be useful if that's what the employer is looking for.
