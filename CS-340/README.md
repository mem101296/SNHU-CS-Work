- How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I try to create my code in a modular format, that can be used for one or many projects if need be. Writing a programn this way helps with maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I add lots of comments and use best practices, which keeps the code readable. The code is writen in a way where it can be changed to accept different databases, and even adapted to use other types of databases by updating each function. Creating a program to be maintainable is accomplished by first open sourcing it, second by using best practices, and third; lots of documentation. 

- How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I feel this question is too general, as each individual has their own way of problem solving. I, myself, read the requirements, write out pseudo code, and then write the first requirement. From there I will rinse and repeat this step until I have a program that meets all requirements.
  
My approach to this class did not differ from other classes, as I have found what works and have stuck to it.

- What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

This question is a bit too broad, as in my experience, Computer Scientists can do anything from IT, to Software Security, to being the CTO or CFO.

My work would help a company quickly access and modify data in a database and see that data displayed on multiple graphs. Since my code is modular each graph and row/column of the chart can be modified to meet any requirements given.
