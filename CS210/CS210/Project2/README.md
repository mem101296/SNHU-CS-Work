1. The project was to design software to calculate interest and totals based on given monthly and initial investment.

2. With this project, I feel I did decently well despite only getting a C (This was due to an error in my math and leaving myself two days to complete it). I was able to convert the project from multible files to a single file. I included these files in the repository.

3. The best way I could enhance my code is by solving my issue with multiple files and resolving my math error. I currently am having issues with the files not sharing variable values.

4. The hardest part was getting the files to talk and share data. I overcame this (mainly because I ran out of time) by making this project into a single file.

5. The skill that I learned and believe is most important is the understanding of how to program multiple files. Without this understanding and mindset, more complex projects will be nearly impossible.

6. By using best practices while creating code it allows most devs to read and understand the code. In return that makes the project maintainable and adaptable.
